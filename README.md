# Hercules

Welcome to the Hercules Robot Arm project! This repository showcases a custom-built, 5-axis robotic arm that can be controlled via Wi-Fi.

## Project Overview

Hercules is a robotic arm designed and developed as a demonstration of my skills in hardware design, firmware development, and software engineering. The project includes:

- **Firmware**: Developed for the ESP32 microcontroller in C.
- **Control Software**: A Python-based interface to program the arm via serial connection and control the arm over Wi-Fi.
- **3D Modeling**: The arm was modeled using Blender.
