# Hercules Robot Arm

Welcome to **Hercules**—a custom-built, **5-axis robotic arm** that seamlessly integrates hardware design, embedded firmware, and intuitive software control. This project serves as a demonstration of my expertise in **robotics, electronics, firmware development, and software engineering**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Hercules** is designed for smooth and precise movement, offering **both local and remote control options**. The firmware runs on an **ESP32 microcontroller**, managing real-time servo control, motion sequences, and Wi-Fi connectivity. The Python-based **GUI software** provides an intuitive way to program and operate the robotic arm.

### 🔹 Key Components

- **📟 Firmware** – Developed in **C** for the **ESP32**, the firmware controls servo movements, processes commands over **serial and Wi-Fi**, and handles sequence execution with smooth motion interpolation.
- **💻 Control Software** – A **Python-based GUI** that allows manual control via sliders, buttons, and sequence management tools. It supports **both Serial (USB) and Wi-Fi control**.
- **🎨 3D Modeling** – The robotic arm was **modeled in Blender**, ensuring a functional and aesthetic design.

## 🔑 Features

✅ **Dual Control Modes** – Operate via **Serial (USB)** or **Wi-Fi (HTTP requests)**  
✅ **Smooth Motion Interpolation** – Uses an **easing function** for fluid servo movement  
✅ **Interactive GUI** – Control the arm via **sliders, buttons, and position recording**  
✅ **Motion Sequences** – **Save, edit, and replay** movement sequences for automation  
✅ **Asynchronous & Threaded Execution** – **ESP32 FreeRTOS tasks** and **Python multithreading** for smooth operation  
✅ **3D Modeled Design** – **Blender-modeled** structure for aesthetics and precision
